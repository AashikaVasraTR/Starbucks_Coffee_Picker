# Starbucks_Coffee_Picker
Have you ever been to Starbucks or other coffee shops and had no clue what to order?  For such people, rather than trying out every drink (wasting money) and then picking a favorite, I have built an expert system in JAVA - Which asks the user a set of questions and comes up with a drink that the user can order thereby saving money.  This is a simple prototype with the basic menu from Starbucks and can be applied to any coffee shop to improve their customer service.
